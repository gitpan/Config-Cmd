NAME
    Config::Cmd - Command line to config file two way interface

VERSION
    version 0.002

SYNOPSIS
       # user writes options in a file;
       configcmd parallel -j 8 --verbose
       # stored in ./parallel_conf.yaml

       # same functionality when using the module directly
       use Config::Cmd;
       my $conf = Config::Cmd(section => 'parallel');
       $conf->set('-j 8 --verbose');

       # main application uses the options
       use Config::Cmd;
       my $conf = Config::Cmd(section => 'parallel');
       my $parallel_opts = $conf->get;  # read from ./parallel_conf.yaml
       # call external program
       `$exe $parallel_opts @args`;

DESCRIPTION
    This module makes it easy to take a set of command line options, store
    them into a config file, and read them later in for passing to an
    external program. Part of this distribution is a command line program
    configcmd for writing these options into a file. The main application
    can then use this module to automate reading of these options and
    passing them on.

    The options stored by Command::Cmd and its command line tool use single
    quotes around options with white space, but that can be changed to
    double quotes if needed by using method quote. Usually you will want
    stick with single quotes.

  Finding the configuration files
    The command line program writes into the working directory. The default
    filename is the section name appended with string '_conf.yaml'. This
    file can be moved and renamed.

    The method filename can be used to set the path where the file is found.
    This overrides all other potential places. If the filename has not been
    set, the module uses the section name to find the configuration file
    from the working directory (./[section]_conf.yaml). If that file is not
    found, it looks into user's home directory for a file
    ~/.[section]_conf.yaml.

METHODS
  section
    The obligatory section name for the stored configuration. This string,
    typically a program name, defines the name of the config file.

  filename
    Override method that allows user to determine the filename where a
    config is to be written or read.

  set
    Store the command line into a file as YAML. Returns true value on
    success.

  set_silent
    Same as set() but does not report to STDERR.

  get
    Get the command line options stored in the file as a string.

  quote
    The quote character to put around a string with white spaces by method
    get. Defaults to single quote to make it possible to use double quotes
    for the whole string. Can be set to any string but you would foolish to
    set to anything else than single or double quote character.
